Developing this tool allowed me to interface with our Java backend, and also gave me more experience in various software development tools.[]At my internship at Lucid Software in South Jordan, UT, I implemented various high-level refactors like framework migration and dependency injection. Since these refactors were so vast, I touched many parts of the code and learned how everything connects.></p>
